    # The reduce image filter
</div>

A few years ago I wrote the first prototype of a program called
[img-filter](https://github.com/SarahIsWeird/img-filter). It was pretty slow, but I'd been interested in image
processing for a long time, and I was wondering if I could create cool effects on my own. The first ones weren't very
interesting, like extracting only the red channel of the image. However, I stumbled upon a filter I really like, which
is the reduce filter.

I'm going to share the ins and outs of it with you here, as well as some theory behind images. The goal is that even
if you haven't worked with images yet, you still can get a feel for how this all fits together. Don't get scared by
the math! All the math excluding the color distances is not that important anyway and just serves as a background for
image processing in general.

The TL;DR is that we generate a subset of colors and replace every pixel in the image with the closest color of that
subset. My version of the filter uses equidistant values for each channel. If you want, you can jump straight to
either the <a href="#generating-color-palettes" target="_self">color palette generation</a>
or the <a href="#result" target="_self">result</a>.

## What is an image, anyway?

An image is basically just a big two-dimensional array of pixels. A pixel consists of three values, one for red, one for
green and one for blue. Sometimes there's also a fourth value for transparency called alpha, but we're going to ignore
transparency here. We can also split an image into three sub-images only consisting of one of those three values. This
sub-image is called a *color channel*, or just *channel* for short. Since we work with 24-bit-color images, the values
in the channels range from $0$ to $255$, so each value in the channels is represented by one byte.
($24\ bits / 3\ channels = 8\ bits/channel = 1\ byte / channel$)

Let's try to write it down a bit more mathematically, since that's going to help us later. Let's denote the image as
$I$. That image $I$ with width $w$ and height $h$ consists of pixels $p_{xy}$:

$
I=\begin{pmatrix}
    p_{1,1} & p_{2,1} & p_{3,1} & ... & p_{w,1} \\
    p_{1,2} & p_{2,2} & p_{3,2} & ... & p_{w,2} \\
    p_{1,3} & p_{2,3} & p_{3,3} & ... & p_{w,3} \\
    ... & ... & ... & ... & ... \\
    p_{1,h} & p_{2,h} & p_{3,h} & ... & p_{wh}
\end{pmatrix}
$, where $
p_{xy} = \begin{pmatrix}
    r_{xy} \\
    g_{xy} \\
    b_{xy}
\end{pmatrix}.
$

## Extracting the red channel

These definitions aren't very useful on their own. Let's do something fun with them: Extract an image channel!

The red channel $I_R$ in of itself doesn't do us much good when we try to display it as an image. It only has one value
for each pixel, but we need three. To help us, we can define a function $getR$ this:

$
getR(p) = getR(\begin{pmatrix}
    r \\
    g \\
    b
\end{pmatrix}) = \begin{pmatrix}
    r \\
    0 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}
$

We just set the other channels to $0$. This means that only the values in the red channels are passed into the final
image. We can now apply this function to every pixel in the image:

$
getR(I) = getR(\begin{pmatrix}
    p_{1,1} & p_{2,1} & p_{3,1} & ... & p_{w,1} \\
    p_{1,2} & p_{2,2} & p_{3,2} & ... & p_{w,2} \\
    p_{1,3} & p_{2,3} & p_{3,3} & ... & p_{w,3} \\
    ... & ... & ... & ... & ... \\
    p_{1,h} & p_{2,h} & p_{3,h} & ... & p_{wh}
\end{pmatrix}) = \begin{pmatrix}
    getR(p_{1,1}) & getR(p_{2,1}) & getR(p_{3,1}) & ... & getR(p_{w,1}) \\
    getR(p_{1,2}) & getR(p_{2,2}) & getR(p_{3,2}) & ... & getR(p_{w,2}) \\
    getR(p_{1,3}) & getR(p_{2,3}) & getR(p_{3,3}) & ... & getR(p_{w,3}) \\
    ... & ... & ... & ... & ... \\
    getR(p_{1,h}) & getR(p_{2,h}) & getR(p_{3,h}) & ... & getR(p_{wh})
\end{pmatrix}
$

This might look complicated, but it's really not. This is the same thing written in pseudocode:

```js
for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
        newImage[x][y] = getR(image[x][y]);
    }
}
```

This is what that looks like:

<div className="two-images">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/reduce-filter/doggo.png" alt="The original image" />
        <span>You might be wondering why I've gathered y'all here today</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/reduce-filter/doggo-red.png" alt="Image with only the red channel" />
        <span>Image with only the red channel</span>
    </div>
</div>

Of course we can do the same thing with the green and blue channels, respectively!

$
getG(\begin{pmatrix}
r \\
g \\
b
\end{pmatrix}) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
g \\
0
\end{pmatrix},\ getB(\begin{pmatrix}
r \\
g \\
b
\end{pmatrix}) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
b
\end{pmatrix}
$

And the resulting images are as (un-)interesting as the red one:

<div className="two-images">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/reduce-filter/doggo-green.png" alt="Image with only the green channel" />
        <span>Image with only the green channel</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/reduce-filter/doggo-blue.png" alt="Image with only the blue channel" />
        <span>Image with only the blue channel</span>
    </div>
</div>

## Okay, why do we even need the math?

Of course, the math definitions didn't do us much good until now, they only made things more convoluted. The reality
is however, that most image processing is entirely reliant on the fact that you can view images as matrices! The cool
thing is that you can do almost anything with images if you view them as a matrix: you can multiply them with other
special matrices to rotate, scale, and stretch them. Alternatively, you can define functions for either the entire
matrix or just single pixel values to change how they look. That's what we've just done, even if it was pretty boring.

We also saw that we can represent the RGB values of a pixel as a vector $r_{xy}$. This is a really useful abstraction,
because it lets us put the three channels into relation! For example, we can define the distance between two colors
as the length of the difference of the two vectors:

$
d(c_1,c_2) = |c_2-c_1| = \left|\begin{pmatrix}
    r_2 - r_1 \\
    g_2 - g_1 \\
    b_2 - b_1
\end{pmatrix}\right| = \sqrt{(r_2 - r_1)^2 + (g_2 - g_1)^2 + (b_2 - b_1)^2}
$

This color distance definition is a naÃ¯ve one, since it doesn't factor in perceptual differences of colors. Color
spaces are a complex topic, and if you wish to know more about it, check out the [Wikipedia article on color
difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference). There's a lot of math we could do to improve our
distance definition, but for this filter it's sufficient. If you're feeling adventurous, definitely try to implement
the filter with alternative color spaces and tell me how it goes!

Since we won't actually use the distance itself, and we only compare two distances with each other, we can actually
leave out the square root and compare the squared distances! This saves us having to compute the square root for
each distance, which does add up for big images.

$
d(c_1,c_2)^2 = (r_2 - r_1)^2 + (g_2 - g_1)^2 + (b_2 - b_1)^2
$

And of course, we can also represent this pretty easily in code:

```js
const distanceSquared = (c1, c2) => {
    const dR = c2[0] - c1[0];
    const dG = c2[1] - c1[1];
    const dB = c2[2] - c1[2];

    return dR * dR + dG * dG + dB * dB;
};
```

If we have a set of colors $S$, we can now find the closest color in that set for another color not in that set.
For that, we first calculate all distances of $c$ to the colors in $S$, which gives us a new set $D$.
With that, we define the closest match $m$ to have the least distance to $c$:

$ d(c,m) = min(D), $ where $ D = \left\{d(c,x)|x\in S\right\} $

Suppose we have the colors <span style="background-color: #ff0000;">red</span>,
<span style="color: #000000; background-color: #00ff00;">green</span> and
<span style="background-color: #0000ff;">blue</span>:

$
S = \left\{\begin{pmatrix}
    255 \\
    0 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    255 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    255
\end{pmatrix}\right\}
$

and a fourth color <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #ff8888">pink</span>,

$
c=\begin{pmatrix}
    255 \\
    127 \\
    127
\end{pmatrix}
$.

We can first calculate $D$ and with that the color $m$ with the lowest distance:

$
\begin{split}
D & = \left\{d(c, \text{red}), d(c, \text{green}), d(c, \text{blue})\right\} \\
  & = \left\{179.61, 312.31, 312.31\right\}
\end{split}
$

$ \Rightarrow d(c,\text{red}) = min(D) $

$
\Rightarrow m = \text{red}=\begin{pmatrix}
    255 \\
    0 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}
$

This works a little bit better in code, because we can actually just sort $D$ to get our best color! We also store
the colors of $S$ in $D$ as well, since that makes it a little bit easier for us to get $m$. Lastly, we use the
squared distance instead of the distance, since it's computationally faster.

```js
const findClosestColor = (S, c) => {
    const D = S.map(colorInS => ({
        color: colorInS,
        distance: distanceSquared(colorInS, c)
    }));

    const sortedD = D.sortBy(obj => obj.distance);

    return sortedD[0].color;
};

const colors = [
    [255, 0, 0],
    [0, 255, 0],
    [0, 0, 255]
];

findClosestColor(colors, [255, 127, 127]) === [255, 0, 0]
```

So, red is the closest color to pink! That's... pretty obvious. But of course, I picked an example that's relatively
easy to follow. We're not limited to any amount of colors though, so we can pick and choose $S$ as we like.

## Generating color palettes <span class="anchor-span" id="generating-color-palettes"></span>

And choosing $S$ is definitely the fun part! You can be as creative as you like here, because every set, or palette,
how it's usually known, will get you a different cool effect. The way I originally intended the effect was to reduce
the numbers to $n^3$ equally spaced colors. In the end, I separated the parameters for each channel, since the
effect works a bit better that way.

The idea is that we have three parameters $n_r \geq 2$, $n_g \geq 2$ and $n_b \geq 2$ that tell us how many values
we allow in each channel. In total, we get $n_r*n_g*n_b$ colors. We can define the values of a channel $C$ dependent
on $n$, where we generate a palette with equally spaced values, with the space between them being $s$.

$
C(n)=\left\{\left\lfloor s*i\right\rfloor\ |\ i\in \mathbb{N}_0, 0 \leq i < n\right\},
\text{where}\ s=255 / (n - 1)
$

This looks pretty complicated, but again, the code might be a bit simpler to understand:

```js
const getEquallySpacedValues = (n) => {
    const step = 255 / (n - 1);
    const result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result.push(Math.floor(step * i));
    }

    return result;
};
```

With these equally spaced values, we can now build our color palette:

$
S(n_r, n_g, n_b) = \left\{\left.\begin{pmatrix}
    r \\
    g \\
    b
\end{pmatrix} \right|\ r \in C(n_r), g \in C(n_g), b \in C(n_b)\right\}
$

Or, in code:

```js
const buildColorPalette = (nR, nG, nB) => {
    const S = [];

    for (const r in getEquallySpacedValues(nR)) {
        for (const g in getEquallySpacedValues(nG)) {
            for (const b in getEquallySpacedValues(nB)) {
                S.push([r, g, b]);
            }
        }
    }

    return S;
};
```

So let's look at the simplest case, $n_r=n_g=n_b=2$. This means that we allow $2^3=8$ colors in our image,
<span style="color: #fff; background-color: #000">black</span>,
<span style="background-color: #f00">red</span>,
<span style="color: #000; background-color: #0f0">green</span>,
<span style="background-color: #00f">blue</span>,
<span style="color: #000; background-color: #ff0">yellow</span>,
<span style="color: #000; background-color: #f0f">magenta</span>,
<span style="color: #000; background-color: #0ff">cyan</span> and
<span style="color: #000; background-color: #fff">white</span>.

$
S=\left\{
\begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
    255 \\
    0 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    255 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    255
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
    255 \\
    255 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
    255 \\
    0 \\
    255
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    255 \\
    255
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
    255 \\
    255 \\
    255
\end{pmatrix}
\right\}
$

## The result! <span class="anchor-span" id="result"></span>

We have everything now! We have generated ourselves a reduced color palette and know how to find the closest color
for a given color. Let's do that for every pixel in the image now!

```js
const colorPalette = buildColorPalette(2, 2, 2);

for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
        newImage[x][y] = findClosestColor(colorPalette, image[x][y]);
    }
}
```

And the result looks like this:

<div className="two-images">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/reduce-filter/doggo.png" alt="The original image" />
        <span>The original image</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/reduce-filter/doggo-reduced-222.png" alt="The image with the reduced color palette" />
        <span>The image with the reduced color palette</span>
    </div>
</div>

Since we only have so few colors available in our palette, the result is mostly just red, yellow, white and black.
But since we've defined some functions instead of hard-coding stuff, we can try out my favourite permutation,
$n_r=3$, $n_g=4$ and $n_b=3$!

<div className="two-images">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/reduce-filter/doggo-reduced-343.png" alt="The image reduced with three reds, four greens and three blues" />
        <span>The best boye!</span>
    </div>
</div>

And I think that that looks pretty dope.
