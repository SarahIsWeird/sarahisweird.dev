Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a 20-year-old software developer from the German
state Brandenburg. I'm studying at the [Berlin School of Economics and Law](https://hwr-berlin.de).
I'm in a dual study program, so for about 50% of my semester I work at
[data experts gmbh](https://data-experts.de).

In order of preference, I'm proficient in Kotlin, C/C++, Java and to some extent HTML/CSS/JS.
I also have a bit of experience with Assembly and Swift.

I'm currently listening to [toe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvbcIeR36Ro),
[Chinese Football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pklMeNrovUM),
[LITE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_ZmBl2OV14),
[the band apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZymtEQJQfM),

I didn't do a lot with Haskell yet, but I definitely intend to do more with it, or at least
functional programming in general.

## Python

I don't like Python. I had to work with it because of a university project, in which we're
trying to teach a humanoid robot to play concentration. If you want to read about it,
you can read the (German) paper [here](https://sarahisweird.dev/NAO-Memory.pdf).
Note: I've mostly worked on the image recognition itself.
